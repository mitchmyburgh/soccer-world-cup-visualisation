                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>“O jogo bonito”- the beautiful game</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This term was used by legend Pele to describe the sport of soccer. It is the arguably the most popular sport in the world with most of the countries in the world playing it and millions of fans glued to their television sets every weekend to watch it. This makes the Fifa world cup the most popular and most watched sporting event on the planet.</p>
                    <p>The Fifa world cup finals takes place every four years with 32 teams competing over a period of a month. A total of 64 matches are played at each tournament. This produces a lot of data that is of interest to the millions of soccer lovers all around the world.</p>
                    <p>The problems this data presents to the average soccer fan is that it is mostly stored in tables with countless amounts of columns and rows, with numbers and figures that are enough to confuse even computer science graduates.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this visualization project is to take the data and present it to the average soccer fan in a manner that is easy to understand, analyse and use to prove that the football team he loves so much is truly the best team in the world.</p>

                    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
                    <p>The first visualisation, "The Clubs That Connect The World Cup"<a href="#src1">[1]</a>, from the New York Times shows the connections between players, the clubs they play for and the teams they represent in the soccer world cup. A screen shot is shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
                    <figure>
                      <img id ="fig1" class="img-left" src = "img/litrev/01.png">
                      <figcaption>
                        <strong>Figure 1: </strong> "The Clubs That Connect The World Cup"<a href="#src1">[1]</a> visualisation
                      </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The visualistion allows the user to see these connections by hovering over a particulat 'bubble'. It makes good use of greyscale, fading unnecessary data on hover while still giving the viewer the ability to get an overall feel for the entire dataset while focusing on a specific piece of data. This is shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <figure>
                      <img id ="fig2" class="img-left" src = "img/litrev/02.png">
                      <figcaption>
                        <strong>Figure 2: </strong> "The Clubs That Connect The World Cup"<a href="#src1">[1]</a> visualisation showing use of greyscale
                      </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>"The Clubs That Connect The World Cup" makes use of circles, whose size repsesent the number of players connected to them, however showing one dimensional data as a two dimensional shape is problematic as it is difficult to compare the size of circles, especially when they are similar in size. Furthermore the visualisation breaks this convention by making large circles for popular players (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) in order to display their images. The visualisation also uses green on white which has a low luminance contrast, making it harder to see than a darker colour.</p>
                    <figure>
                      <img id ="fig3" class="img-left" src = "img/litrev/03.png">
                      <figcaption>

                    </figure>
                    <p> The second visualisation, "A Look at the Most Interesting World Cup Visualizations and Champion Predictions"<a href="#src2">[2]</a>, seen in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, shows the probability of different teams winning the soccer world cup.</p>
                    <p>The visualisation also makes good use of greyscale, highlighting the most likely winner, while still allowing the viewer to have an overview of the data. The data is also easily visible and comparable, and multiple dimensions are shown.</p>
                    <p>The visualisation uses yellow on white which provides a low luminance contrast making it difficult to discern, and coupled with this it is not immediately apparent what the data means.</p>
                    <figure>
                      <img id ="fig4" class="img-left" src = "img/litrev/04.png">
                      <figcaption>

                      </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The third visualisation, taken from the Fifa website<a href="#src3">[3]</a> shows the teams that participated in the soccer world cup. We liked the use of the map (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>) to display the information because it adds a location dimension to data so we integrated it into our final visualisation. We also like the use of flags (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>) and this was also integrated into the design. The use of greyscale in the small maps of <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> was also well used. The block showing a zoomed in version of Europe is helpful in displaying the data as Europe has a number of small soccer-playing countries.</p>
                    <figure>
                      <img id ="fig5" class="img-left" src = "img/litrev/05.png">

                      </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The visualisation shows the same set of data in both <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> and <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> this makes one of the parts redundent, and could be replaced with more information. The visualisation also makes poor use of hover over on the map showing only the countries name, where there could be much more data.</p>
                    <figure>

                    <p>The fourth visualisation, "A look<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>en colour, and markings which clearly indicate that it is a soccer field.</p>
                    <p><a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> however places yellow dots on a green field providing a low luminace contrast (even though the green is darker, it is not as effective as black dots on a white field). and the hover over obscures the data, and does not make use of any depth cues besides occlusion.</p>
                    <figure>
                      <img id ="fig7" class="img-left" src = "img/litrev/07.png">

                      </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a> the hover over also obscures the data, and it is difficult to find what each block means without hovering. The names of the countries also are a light grey against a light grey background and could be made more visually distinct by making the text black.</p>

                    <h2>Visual Queries Supported</h2>
                    <p>Visual queries are questions the user can answer by looking at and analysing the visualization. These consist of acts of attention and which drive eye movement and help activate users pattern recognition capabilities. The visual queries supported by this design are divided into several sections as the data used is multi-dimensional.</p>

                    <p>
                        The data used for the visualistion was taken from Wikipedia and the openfootball<a href="#src5">[5]</a> Github repository. The data from openfootball was the initial dataset but due to the difficulty of parsing the data (as the data was in structured text format and different years had slightly differently structured data) a parser was not built and data was manually extracted from openfootball and Wikipedia. Due to this some data is simply replicated over the years to give an idea of how the visualisation would work.

                    <h2>Description of Design</h2>
                    <p>The design consists of three main elements, a world map, a timeline and graphs to compare data. The user is first presented with a world map that represents an overview of world cup data. There are options above the map which allow users to view specific details on the data. The timeline below the map shows the countries that have hosted a world cup, the specific year as well as  the winner for that particular year. When the user selects a specific world cup the data for that world cup is represented on the map and the graph below. The user is able to filter data according to the visual query that needs to be answered.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, when the user is viewing the data for all world cups these are the options available:</p>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Countries that have competed in a world cup are coloured in, countries that have never competed are greyed out</li>
                      <li>The colour of each country represents the best finish that a country has achieved at a world cup</li>
                      <li>All the countries that have ever hosted a world cup have a horizontal line texture</li>
                      <li>When a user hovers over a specific country a pop-up appear showing the details of the country’s world cup performances</li>
                      <li>When a user hovers over a certain value in the key the countries that have that specific value is highlighted and the rest is greyed out, with countries that have competed in a darker grey</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Goals Scored</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Countries that have scored goals in world cups are coloured in according to the number of goals they have scored</li>
                      <li>The graph below shows how many goals were scored at each world cup so that the user is able to compare different world cups</li>
                      <li>When a bar in the graph is hovered over it shows the top scoring country in that world cup and the amount of goals that country scored</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Top Scorer</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Each country is coloured in according to the number of top scorers they have had in all world cups</li>
                      <li>The graph below shows the number of goals scored by the top scorer in each world cup</li>
                      <li>When a bar is in the graph is hovered over it shows the name and country of the top scorer in that world cup</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Attendance</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Each country that has ever hosted a world cup is coloured in according to the number of fans that attended matches</li>
                      <li>The graph below shows the number of fans that attended matches in each specific world cup</li>
                      <li>When a bar in the bar graph is hovered over the country that hosted and the exact attendance number is shown</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The user is also able to select a specific world cup to view that data pertaining to it. When a user selects a world cup the following options are available:</p>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <ul>

                    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
                    <p>Using the content and principles learned in the course our group gained a good understanding on how human beings perceive and process data being presented to them. This knowledge was used when making decisions on the design of our visualisation.</p>
                    <h3>Map</h3>
                    <p>As the Fifa soccer world cup is one of the largest events in the world involving a large number of countries the use of a world map was decided upon. This makes use of the user's pattern recognition abilities as he/she has to find the country they are interested in on the map. The use of the map also made it easy for the data pertaining to each country to be displayed and viewed which aids the answering of visual queries the user has.</p>
                    <h3>Graphs</h3>
                    <p>The map gives users an overview of the data but to allow the user to inspect the data more closely graphs were used. This allows the user to compare the data from each world cup with other world cups.</p>
                    <h3>Timeline</h3>
                    <p>A timeline was used to show all the world cups, the hosts and winners from 1930 to 2014. This was used as it represents tournaments that are held every four years and it allows users to see this and gather the necessary information from it with very little effort.</p>
                    <h3>Tree</h3>
                    <p>To represent the matches in a specific world cup a tree was used. This relies on the user's pattern recognition abilities as this design is used often to represent this type of data. It shows the progression of the winner through the competition and allows users to view data pertaining to single matches.</p>
                    <h3>Colour</h3>
                    <p>Different colour scales were used in each category of information, this was to help the user differentiate between the different categories quickly and easily. Most of the colours used are unique hues for humans.</p>
                    <p>Colours for each category:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Overview
                        <ul>
                          <li>Dark green to dark purple
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Goals scored
                        <ul>
                          <li>Dark orange/red to light orange/yellow
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Top Scorer
                        <ul>
                          <li>Dark pink to light pink
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Attendance
                        <ul>
                          <li>Dark blue to light blue
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The colours mentioned above were used on the map as well as the graphs to show that the data shown in both objects were related.</p>
                    <p>For the background of the map a dark grey was used to create a chromatic contrast between the countries and the ocean, this made the lighter colours pop out and made the colour of each country easily identifiable to the user. The text on the grey background was made white to create a luminance contrast which made the text pop-out and easy to read.</p>
                    <p>To make the visualisation more pleasing a green grass texture was used as a border. This ties in with the soccer theme and gives the user an idea of what the visualisation is about at first glance.</p>
                    <h3>Texture</h3>
                    <p>Textures are used on the map to differentiate host nations from other nations on the map. This was decided upon as it uses two visual channels (colour and texture) to give the user information on a specific country.</p>
                    <h3>Symbols</h3>
                    <p>Symbols were used throughout the visualization. This relies on the user’s pattern recognition ability as contours and gist of objects are used to help the user identify what the particular symbol means thus understanding what the data represented by the symbol means. The symbols used in the visualisation were:</p>
                    <h4>Soccer pitch</h4>
                    <p>A soccer pitch is used to represent information on host nations. </p>
                    <h4>Trophy</h4>
                    <p>A trophy was used to represent world cup winners.</p>
                    <h4>Soccer Boot</h4>
                    <p>This was used to represent top scorers in each tournament.</p>
                    <h4>People</h4>
                    <p>This was used to represent the attendance numbers at each tournament.</p>
                    <h4>Flags</h4>
                    <p>To make each the data pertaining to each country easily recognisable to the user the flags of each country was used. This relies on the user's ability to recognise these flags, the name of the country was also used in case the user is unable to recognise flags.</p>

                <div id="iter">
                    <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
                    <p>We have gone through 3 design iterations in order to fine tune our visualisation to the point where it most conforms to the design principles. In order for us to create a visualisation which will allow the viewer to gain rapid access to multiple visual queries, while still maintaining cohesiveness, we made use of 3 visual elements, a map, timeline and a bar graph. These visual elements allowed us to represent data of the same subject in different ways, giving the viewer a holistic view of the subject. The subjects we represented were goals scored, top scorer and attendance.</p>
                    <p>Through critiquing the design at each iteration, we managed to note problems with our design and come up with solutions for them.</p>
                    <h3>Iteration 1</h3>
                    <figure>
                      <img id ="fig8" class="img-left" src = "img/tumelo/01.jpeg">
                      <figcaption>
                        <strong>Figure 8: </strong> First Iteration overview map and timeline
                      </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                      <img id ="fig9" class="img-left" src = "img/tumelo/02.jpeg">
                      <figcaption>
                        <strong>Figure 9: </strong> First Iteration bar charts
                      </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In order to reach our 1st formal design, we went through 3 other designs where we attempted to use various visual components in order to develop a visualisation which not only display multiple dimensions of data, but is also intuitive and represents the data best.</p>
                    <p>We ended up going with this design since we felt the following attributes conformed to the design principles the best:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Has multi dimensional data</li>
                      <li>Countries competing in the world cup are distinguished on 2 visual channels in timeline (Flag and name)</li>
                      <li>Use of recognisable symbols improves learnability (i.e. Trophy for winner)</li>
                      <li>Use of occlusion makes information effectively noticeable (i.e. on Map hover over)</li>
                      <li>Ability to compare the same visual query across different years (i.e. bar chart can be used to compare WC attendance in world cups)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After further critiquing our designs , we noted several areas of improvement for it , namely:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Having an overview map that lists all the teams that have competed in a world cup</li>
                      <li>Solving the congestion issue in the map where in certain continents (i.e. Europe), many teams have competed in the world cup, making it hard to get an exact perspective on the competing teams</li>
                      <li>The misleading representation of the attendance in countries that have hosted a world cup (the variance between the attendance figures leads to this)</li>
                      <li>The orientation of the bar chart on the visualisation</li>
                      <li>The lack of symbols on the bar chart</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We solved these problems the following way</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>We improved the overview map to include a list of countries that have competed in the world cup</li>
                      <li>We added a zoom feature in order to solve the problem of certain regions being cluttered</li>
                      <li>We changed the attendance range from a continuous scale to a category based scale in order to effectively represent the data, with the exact figure shown on the hover over of the bar chart</li>
                      <li>We changed the orientation of the bar chart, in order to make the information more easily retrievable</li>
                      <li>We added symbols to the bar graph which are accessible on hovering over the graph</li>
                      <li>We have reduced the clutter of information on the visualisation and made some of the information accessible through secondary gestures, i.e hovering over</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Iteration 2</h3>
                    <p>In our <a href="/v0.5/visualisation.html">second iteration</a>, we attempted to solve all the problems we noted from our first iteration. We aimed to refine our visualisation in the best way possible, however, we still noted several minor problems, namely:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>We had a high saturation of colours in  our overview map, which made the visualisation harder on the eyes and made it difficult to discern between the dark background with objects shaded in dark colours, due to the poor luminance contrast </li>
                      <li>The years in the timeline had a low amount of colour saturation, which made them harder to discern from the background , and were also closely spaced together</li>
                      <li>The blocks in the the goals scored key were only distinguished through 1 visual channel, colour, which made it hard to discern between them</li>
                      <li>The pop ups used in the map were small and lacked opacity, which obscured information from the user through making it hard to read the data within them and also obscuring data behind them</li>
                      <li>The wide bars on the bar chart made it hard to compare figures effectively when the figures are not too far off from each other</li>
                      <li>The small font on the bar chart made it hard for the viewer to see the information</li>
                      <li>The lack of clarity on which countries hosted the world cup on the timeline made it hard to discern the two</li>
                      <li>The poor luminance contrast on labels in the axis with the background made it hard to distinguish the two</li>
                      <li>The small spacing on the radio selections and labels made it hard to distinguish them</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We solved these problems by:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Reducing the colour saturation in the overview map</li>
                      <li>Making the year in timeline bigger and bolder and adding spacing between the elements</li>
                      <li>Increasing the size of key the blocks in the goals scored visual query</li>
                      <li>Making the popups appearing when the viewer hovers over the map bigger , transparent and also increasing the text size</li>
                      <li>Making the bar chart bars narrower</li>
                      <li>Differentiating between the host and winner on the timeline with an icon</li>
                      <li>Removing the space around the timeline</li>
                      <li>Changing the colour of axis labels in the small graphs  to white</li>
                      <li>Increasing spaces between radio selections and labels to differentiate between them effectively</li>
                      <li>Adding axis labels on small graphs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Final Design Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Our <a href="/visualisation.html">final design</a> brings together all the strengths of our previous designs, and builds on them in order to create a design which not only adheres to visual principles but is also visually appealing.</p>
                    <p>With this design, we aimed to find a middle ground between the top down and bottom up information processing procedures that take place when we perceive visual information in order to enhance it’s effectiveness. </p>
                    <p>We used the following top down features, in order to capture the user’s attention:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A grassy background, which makes use of gist perception in order to get the user to characterise the scene to a soccer context</li>
                      <li>Known icons such as trophies and flags to make use of previously learned concepts to make the visualisation as intuitive as possible</li>
                      <li>Colours with unique hues for humans in order to draw attention to important visual elements</li>
                      <li>A variation of certain visual elements through 2 visual channels, i.e goals scored key which vary through size and colour</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We also made use of the following bottom up features, in order to convey information to the user in the event that they would like to interrogate the visualisation further:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A hover over feature, which  brings additional information to light when the user moves their cursor above a graphic representing a visual element which conveys a lot of information (i.e exact attendance numbers on bar chart, specific information on competing countries in the world cup on the map hover over)</li>
                      <li>Radio selections in order to allow the user to filter through information as they choose</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In order to make our design more visually appealing , we also avoided using a high amount of saturation for large graphical elements and made use of continuous colour scales in order to represent a progression in certain visual elements (i.e. attendance, goals scored and top scorer key)</p>
                    <p>In spite of the changes that we have made to the visualisation , it still has various areas of improvement, namely:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The timeline currently does not display any further information about competing teams in a specific world cup once it is clicked</li>
                      <li>The bar charts would be more easily distinguishable if they had the years written on the individual bars</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div id="con">
                    <h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
                    <p>The visualisation that we have created aims to educate the viewer on various soccer world cup statistics in the quickest and most intuitive way possible , through making use of visual principles that make information retrieval as rapid as possible. Through the use of principles that communicate with both top down and bottom up information processing techniques that we use to interpret information , we have aimed to make information retrieval as quick and easy as possible.</p>
                    <p>Areas for future work on our visualisation are:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The timeline: It can be improved to display more information on various stages of the world cup , as proposed in the 1st iteration</li>
                      <li>The bar chart can be improved in order to more easily convey information to the viewer</li>
                    </ul>
